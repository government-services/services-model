<!--For serviceType I wanted to use OpenEligibility. Based on what I could find on that github repo: https://github.com/auntbertha/openeligibility/blob/master/taxonomy, I summarized as above. Below, I have tried to illustrate my path just in case in needs to be revised. I assumed that if I used the most specific category for "@services", that all higher order info would also be captured.:
