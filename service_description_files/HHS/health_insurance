For serviceType I wanted to use OpenEligibility. Based on what I could find on that github repo: https://github.com/auntbertha/openeligibility/blob/master/taxonomy, I summarized as above. Below, I have tried to illustrate my path just in case in needs to be revised. I assumed that if I used the most specific category for "@services", that all higher order info would also be captured.:

In-Person Assistance (IPA) programs and Certified Application Counselor (CAC) organizations can help you navigate the federally facilitated health insurance Marketplace. They can help you determine whether or not you qualify for financial assistance (i.e., subsidy) and evaluate what type of coverage might be best for you and your family. You can also receive help enrolling in Children’s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), and Medicaid if applicable. These government programs help you pay for health care.”,

For audience I wanted to include OpenEligibility situations. Based on what I could find on that github repo: https://github.com/auntbertha/openeligibility/blob/master/taxonomy, I summarized as above. Below, I have tried to illustrate my path just in case in needs to be revised. I assumed that if I used the most specific category for "@situations", that all higher order info would also be captured. I did not use General because the schema.org audiences should capture general audiences:
